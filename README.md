## ***Git/GitHub Tutorial***
1. Create an account!

2. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop down menu and click New Repository. Name your repository and make sure to check off "Add a README file."

3. Make the Repo Public or Private depending on the level of access you want, and create it.

4. In the Repo, you can create files of any editable filetype in the Code tab, such a .HTML, .PHP, .YML, etc. Or you can upload pre-existing files.

5.  Additionally, if you click on the main branch button in the code tab, you can create branches to test new features for your project without worrying about changing foundational code.

6. Whenever you edit a file, in order to save your changes to the repository, you have to commit the changes. At the bottom of the file you're editing, you can commit it to a specific branch, and add a brief description of what was changed.
7. Finally, when viewing files, you can make a pull request to make changes on public repositories. Administrators can pull your changes into the branch you're attempting to edit if it coincides with the repository's needs.

## ***GIT***
###### GIT is a version control system that tracks changes in any set of files.

## ***Git vs GitHub***
###### Git is a local version control system. GitHub is a cloud based version control system accessible from the web or an application. With this, you can share code with others and collaborate.

## ***Repository***
###### A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

## ***Commit***
###### A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

## ***Push***
###### The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. This essentially pushes your changes on your local git repo to your cloud repo on github.

## ***Pull***
###### The pull command allows you to fetch new code from other remote files and merge them with your current work. 

## ***Branches*** 
###### Branches are self-contained parts of your repository that allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas

## ***Merge*** 
###### Merges are used to combine two branches together, when merging branches, the commits of one branch are combined with another in one large commit.

## ***Merge Conflicts***
###### A merge conflict occurs when you try to merge two branches that have competing commits. For example, if one file in one branch was deleted but only edited in the other. GitHub will prompt you to resolve this manually, or it can automatically attempt a merge.

## ***Fetch***
###### This allows you to retrieve commits and files from a remote repository.

## ***Remote***
###### A remote is a common repoistory stored in cloud based source code management systems such as gitHub and can be cloned locally.
